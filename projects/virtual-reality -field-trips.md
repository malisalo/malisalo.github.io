summary: "My team developed a virtual reality field trip on conversation sites in Oahu."
---
I created virtual reality field trips for the different conservation sites around Oahu in order to make learning accessible for individuals who are unable to physically attend because of disabilities, COVID-19, or personal reasons. The virtual reality field trips were meant to recreate these real life learning experiences and also shed light on the environmental issues that are occuring on our island. I created trips for the Nanakuli Wetland, Palehua, and Piliokahe Beach Park, which are sites that are currently suffering from environmental issues, such as erosion, pollution, and coral bleaching. While on the actual conservation site, I also made time to volunteer by cleaning up these polluted areas and planting Native Hawaiian plants in order to resolve the erosion issue at these sites.

In order to gain access to these conversation sites, me and my team collaborated with KUPU and Malama Learning Center, which are both non-profit organizations that focus on environmental conversation around Oahu. I gathered my information from advisors that work at these non-profits in order to gain a better understanding of how their volunteer work is making a positive contribution to the environment on Oahu. In order to gather high quality photos of these sites, I used a drone and a 360 camera so the users can gain a better look at these sites. At the end of my project, I got the chance to showcase my project at the Hawaii Agriculture Conference and the Hawaii Conservation Conference to other environmental organizations around Hawaii
