summary: "I painted an art mural for my high school in order to spread kindness to our students."
---
In order to spread kindness to my old high school, I painted a mural in the hallways where students pass by everyday. Painting an anti-bullying mural is a powerful act of art.  With the help of my classmate and my art teacher, we designed an art mural from a $500 funding that I received from an art contest. I have been passionate about art ever since middle school. I have been applying to art contests and winning multiple awards for my creativity. With this project, I wanted to give back to my own community and spread kindness to others.
