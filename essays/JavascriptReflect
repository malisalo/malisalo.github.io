As someone who started learning how to code for the first time with Java, learning Javascript made me realize how simple coding can be! Although I have experience in other coding languages, such as Java, C, and C++, Javascript is so far my favorite language to learn due to its syntax and paradigms that makes it significantly different from other languages. 

When I was first learning how to code in Java, I was constantly looking up functions that would convert integers to strings, or doubles to integers. The amount of typing required for Java made the language very difficult to memorize the syntax and debug your code. Now with Javascript, the syntax for your code is heavily simplified because of the use of variable types such as let, var, and const. Each of these variables has different scopes from each other, so it is very important to know when and how to use these variable types. These variable types can easily convert from different variable types to another just by reassigning the variables, instead of using functions like “Integer.toString()”, which is used in Java programs. Just by coding in Javascript, you can save yourself from writing hundreds of lines of unnecessary code. Although there are some downsides of using these variable types, using let, var, and const, makes Javascript programs easy to read and understand, especially for beginners to programing. 

Javascript has a more flexible syntax compared to other languages such as Java and C. I think this loose syntax can allow programmers to easily create a program for web applications in order to create the most efficient application for their users as soon as possible. Software developers are able to easily create objects in their code without 

The concept of solving coding problems or WODS (workout of the day) in a limited amount of time sounded very intimidating at first, however, it also motivated me to constantly test my ability to solve coding problems in an efficient manner. Consistently solving these WODs will become useful to the future generation of software engineers because it sets up a stressful environment to be successful in coding interviews. Every software engineering company wants an employee who can get the job done efficiently. Although these timed coding problems can create a stressful environment for me to work in, this stress is ultimately meant to improve the fluency of future programmers!!!
