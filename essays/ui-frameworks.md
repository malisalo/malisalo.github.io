Building your very own website can be both a fun and frustrating learning experience to go through. When I was first introduced to CSS, I always had a difficult time trying to build a column on my webpage. Just using raw HTML and CSS to build your website can have you writing multiple lines of redundant code. I think using UI frameworks like Bootstrap can help you achieve the design and applications for your website with fewer lines of CSS. Once you get the hang of Bootstrap, you will find that many of Bootstrap’s features can make CSS much more simpler.

## The importance of Bootstrap
When my Software Engineering class first introduced Bootstrap to me, my first thought was “What is the whole point of learning all of this? We already know plain CSS and HTML, so why is it important to understand how to use Bootstrap?” After building a few web pages with Bootstrap, all of my questions were answered. I was able to create a visually pleasing web page with Bootstrap in less than an hour. Taking the time to understand navbars, footers, and flex boxes really helped me efficiently create web pages.

## The downsides
Although the features of Bootstrap can make web development easier, one issue that I came across with Bootstrap was how difficult it can be to read your HTML file. With all of the styling and elements in the HTML file, I found myself getting lost inside the file. Sometimes it would take 40 minutes to figure out that a small typo was causing my webpage to not work. However, this can easily be fixed by commenting out your HTML file and labeling the classes of your elements wisely.

## Seeing web pages in a new perspective
Learning about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, opened up my eyes to a new perspective of web development. When I am on a nice web page, I find myself inspecting the webpage to see what elements and styling was used in order to create the page. I feel like I learned a lot about web development in such a short amount of time. Although I am now able to create webpages using Bootstrap, there is a lot more to learn in order to create a functional and well-designed website that other users are happy to use.
