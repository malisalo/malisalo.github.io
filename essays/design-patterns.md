## Introducing Design Patterns...
If you are an owner of a bakery that is known for its delicious desserts, consistency in taste and providing exceptional service to customers are crucial goals. In order to make your bakery the best in town, you have designed different solutions in order to address recurring problems that you see in your business operations. Although software engineers typically don’t bake cakes, they similarly develop solutions to recurring problems within their code, known as Design Patterns. Failing to implement design patterns in your software engineering projects can resemble baking one batch of cookies overly sweet and another batch far too bland. Such inconsistency lacks organizational structure and coherence.

## My challenges with design patterns
Design patterns can be a tricky concept for beginners who are getting into software engineering, this includes myself. While working on the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) along with my 2 group members, the concept of design patterns were unclear. We wanted our application to have different features and functionalities as soon as possible, however, creating clean and reusable code was very difficult, especially within a team of newbies in software engineering.

In the course of the project, I wanted to implement a seemingly straightforward addition: a 'required field' message to prompt users when submitting an empty modal. However, the way the modal page was coded and designed made it difficult to add this new feature. Consequently, I adjusted the functionality so that the 'required field' prompt would display upon opening a new modal, highlighting blank fields in red with the message preloaded. Initially, my intent was for the message to trigger exclusively upon submitting a blank modal, not upon initial modal access. While looking back on the code with my teammates, we found out that the code for the modal page could have been simplified and more straightforward. If the code followed a simple design, and the concept of design patterns, implementing my initial intent for the ‘required field’ messages could have been done easily.

## Should everyone use design patterns
Several design patterns can often be complex and difficult to understand, leading some software engineers to misuse them to inappropriate problems. This misuse can make your code more complicated rather than solving the actual problem. Admittedly, both my teammates and I are guilty of not following some design patterns, however, we didn’t want to write code in a way where we couldn’t understand what we were doing. I think some software engineers attempt to implement design patterns without a complete grasp of their concepts, sometimes driven by time constraints or lack of motivation. I've personally found myself in situations where I just need to get my code working, only to realize that this way of coding is more detrimental to my software engineering learning than any good. Although me and my teammates did not implement some design patterns into our project, we built our project with the purpose of learning more about software engineering. If you are a complete beginner to software engineering, I think it is totally fine to not implement design patterns in your code right away. Get down the basics first, then you can slowly learn about design patterns. With years of experience and practice, you can make design patterns seem as simple as pie!
