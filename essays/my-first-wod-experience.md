When the clock started ticking, my heart started racing. During the first WOD of ICS 314, I was very nervous and made some mistakes along the way. In order to prepare for this first WOD, I learned that timing yourself and solving different coding problems that are given by the TA or professor has helped me complete this WOD. Leetcode also has some challenging coding problems and shows different solutions that have a better time complexity or are more space efficient. I think trying to solve these problems yourself first, and comparing your answers to other solutions afterwards is a great way to gain familiarity with Javascript. During the actual WOD, I made minor mistakes on the output which affected the time of my completion of the WOD. Because of this mistake, I learned that I should read the WOD’s instructions carefully before starting to code. I think with a time limit, I was so focused on finishing the problem that I misread some of the instructions. For the next WOD, I think taking the time to understand the instructions is very important because if you make a mistake while coding, you are taking up more time to complete the problem. 

## I solved the WOD, but I could do better...
The experience of the first WOD was very nerve-racking and challenging at the same time. This WOD allowed me to gain a better sense of what future WODs are going to be like and how the TA’s are going to grade them. To solve the WOD, I used “==” and “!=” to see if numbers 1-100 were either only multiples of 4 or only multiples of 6. After those 2 conditions, I checked if the numbers were both multiples of 4 and 6. I chose to solve the WOD this way because I didn’t want the numbers that were both multiples of 4 and 6 to print out the first “if” statement in my program. After submitting my WOD, I realized that I could have checked if the numbers were both multiples of 4 and 6 first, then checked if it was only multiples of 4 or only multiples of 6 afterwards. This solution only requires “==” and doesn’t require the use of “!=”. The professor also showed that the WOD could be done by using recursion. I think this solution was a smart way to solve the problem, but I wouldn’t implement it this way because I think recursion is difficult to code in a short amount of time.

## Learning Javascript from a different perspective
Having a class discussion after the WOD showed me that there were many ways to solve this problem. I also learn a lot from these discussions because some students were able to use the different features of Javascript, such as the dictionary, in order for their program to work. These discussions overall helped me look at the WODs from different perspectives and get a better understanding of Javascript’s different functions that it has to offer.
